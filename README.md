# Minesweeper
## Project Overview 
This is a simple version of the classic game minesweeper that is played from the command prompt. I created it using
Python because I felt like this project would be a fun way for me to test out my proffeincy in the langauge. Overall 
I think that development went smoothly, and I might add some more features in the future like a GUI and a built in solver 
that can give the user best next move for if they get stuck.
## Installation and running the game
This current itteration of the project is played in the command prompt, so to play it you just download the Minesweeper.py
then navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file in your command prompt and run Minesweeper.py using python. You will 
need Python to be installed already in order to play.
## Rules of the game 
This version of Minesweeper has the same rules as classic Minesweeper. I made 3 difficulties that you can play, easy, medium, and hard.
Easy has 9 rows, 9 columns, and 10 mines. Medium has 16 rows, 16 columns, and 40 mines. Hard has 16 rows, 30 columns, and 99 mines.
